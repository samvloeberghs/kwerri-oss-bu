        For the past 3 years ( and probably some more years to come ) I've been in roles where I take the role as
        technical lead. For me this role is not about telling people what to do, but trying to lead the team in using
        the correct technologies and applying them keeping in mind best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last projects I worked on all used Angular v2+. The framework allows us to implement business functionality
        at a rapid pace but I noticed that many developers are forgetting about the basics that surround Angular. And
        one of those basics is just plain old simple HTML. <strong>But is it that simple?</strong> Using it badly is,
        unfortunately..

    <h2>A pretty nasty disease called Divitis</h2>

    <p>
        Many developers, mostly the ones fairly new to webdevelopment, diving immediatly into a big framework like
        Angular or React quickly suffer from a disease called <em>Divitis</em>. Divitis is a rather old term and is
        referenced by
        <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divitis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The practice of authoring web-page code with many div elements in place of meaningful semantic HTML elements.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        It seems that the first occurence of Divitis dates back to 2003 in a book by <a
            href="https://twitter.com/zeldman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeffrey-Zeldman</a>, called "<a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-Jeffrey-Zeldman/dp/0321616952"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designing with Web Standards</a>". <strong>This doesn't make it less
        actual.</strong> The core &amp; base of HTML elements has not been changed dramatically the last 2 decades,
        except for the introduction of more semantic elements with HTML5 like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
        and others. More information and a nice overview can be found in <a
            href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/use-html5-sectioning-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            title="How to Use The HTML5 Sectioning Elements">this nice article</a>
        by <a href="https://twitter.com/mattantwest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt West</a>. The disease of
        Divitis can only be cured by the medicine of learning :)

    <h2>Some common mistakes &amp; bad-practices</h2>

    <p>
        While doing code reviews of HTML of the projects I work on I come accross mistakes &amp; bad-practices that come
        back every time. Writing this blogpost also served as base to get my own HTML structure in order :)
    </p>

    <h3>Correct emphasizing</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> & <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags are used for emphasizing text. Although it's
        possible to change the styles of these elements using CSS, doing it would not make sense. These tags are
        typically refered to as presentational tags. The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag refers to <em>bold</em> and
        the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag refers to <em>italic</em>. Changing the CSS would change the semantic meaning of
        the tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> & <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags defines more semantic meaning to what your
        emphasizing. The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag is mainly used to stress the importance of an entire sentence,
        while <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is typically used to stress the importance of one word in a longer text or
        sentence.

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <pre><code class="html highlighted"></code></pre>

    <p>results in:</p>

            </a>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Using ids for existing elements</h3>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <pre><code class="html highlighted"></code></pre>

    <p>results in:</p>

    <h4>References</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href=""
               title="">

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Incorrectly building & styling lists</h3>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <pre><code class="html highlighted"></code></pre>

    <p>results in:</p>

    <h4>References</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href=""
               title="">

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Placement of block elements inside inline element</h3>


    - makes editors go crazy

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <pre><code class="html highlighted"></code></pre>

    <p>results in:</p>

    <h4>References</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href=""
               title="">

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <pre><code class="html highlighted">import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'sv-app',
  template: '&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;'
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(private readonly router: Router) {

    router.events
      .filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd)
      .subscribe((event: NavigationEnd) => {
        window.scroll(0, 0);
      });

  }
}
</code></pre>

    <h2>Why take care of HTML?</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes I get the remark that the structure of the HTML is not that important as nobody sees it.. Here are
        some reasons why you should take care of structuring your HTML in a correct and semantic way:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            SEO
        </li>
        <li>
            Semantic description
        </li>
        <li>
            Screen readers
        </li>
        <li>
            Lighter code & better developer comprehension
        </li>
    </ul>
