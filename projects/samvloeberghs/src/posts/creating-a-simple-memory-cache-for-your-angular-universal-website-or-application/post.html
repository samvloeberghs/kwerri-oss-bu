  <p>
    This article and guide on <em>setting up a simple memory cache for an Angular Universal website or application</em>
    is targeted to developers that are optimizing their server for better performance. The goal is to
    <em>avoid rerendering the page</em> of the application on the server if there is no need to. Instead we will cache
    the previously generated content and serve it from the cache on subsequent requests.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
    This concept is of course not limited to Angular applications or any other web-application framework or technology
    for that matter. It is a widely adopted <em>common practice for server optimization</em> to minimize the load on
    the processor. The concepts explained can easily be adopted to your framework or technology of choice.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    Our example application
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    To explain the basics and prove the concept we have to consider an example application, like for example my simple
    blog, the website you are currently visiting :) This Angular Universal implementation has some <em>static pages
    containing the content in their components</em>, and <em>dynamic pages, loading blogposts from a JSON
    datasource</em> into their components.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have for example the static
    <code><a href="/about" target="_blank">/about</a></code> route and a dynamic blogpost route
    <code><a href="/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation" target="_blank">/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation</a></code>.
    Angular Universal is capable of knowing when the application and blogpost is completely generated.
    <em>As soon as the application is stable, the static HTML is retrieved and send back as the response of the
      request.</em>
  </p>

    <span>Simple diagram for basic rendering</span>
  </h3>

    alt="Angular Universal : Basic rendering diagram / flow"
    class="extraspace"/>

  <p>
    The diagram above shows the most basic example of the Angular Universal rendering flow. Let's go trough the steps
    shown:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The browser requests a specific page from your server, for example the dynamic page
      <code><a href="/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation" target="_blank">/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation</a></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server receives the request and renders the Angular application by fetching the content from the JSON
      datasource.
    </li>
    <li>
      The renderer outputs the static HTML and the server returns this in the response to the browser.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <span>Code for basic rendering</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    The code for this basic rendering case is available trough the Angular CLI. The <a
    href="https://angular.io/guide/universal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation on the
    Angular website will get you going really fast</a>. For the sake of this tutorial, the following code and especially
    <em>the highlighted parts starting at line 44</em> are the most important ones for our usecase:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">basic-angular-universal-server-setup.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="44-57"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">// These are important and needed before anything else
import 'zone.js/dist/zone-node';
import 'reflect-metadata';

import { renderModuleFactory } from '@angular/platform-server';
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import * as express from 'express';
import { join } from 'path';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

// * NOTE :: leave this as require() since this file is built Dynamically from webpack
const { AppServerModuleNgFactory, LAZY_MODULE_MAP } = require('../../../dist/samvloeberghs/server/main');
const { provideModuleMap } = require('@nguniversal/module-map-ngfactory-loader');

// Faster server renders w/ prod mode
enableProdMode();

// Express server
const app = express();
const PORT = 80;
const DIST_FOLDER = join(process.cwd(), 'server', 'samvloeberghs');

app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', join(DIST_FOLDER, 'browser'));

// serve static files from /browser
app.get('*.*', express.static(join(DIST_FOLDER, 'browser')));

// Our index.html we'll use as our template
const template = readFileSync(join(DIST_FOLDER, 'browser', 'index.html')).toString();

app.engine('html', (_, options, callback) => {
  renderModuleFactory(AppServerModuleNgFactory, {
    document: template,
    url: options.req.url,
    extraProviders: [
      provideModuleMap(LAZY_MODULE_MAP),
    ],
  }).then(html => {
    callback(null, html);
  });
});

const ngApp = (req, res) => {
  const config = {
    req,
    res,
    preboot: true,
    baseUrl: '/',
    requestUrl: req.originalUrl,
    originUrl: 'https://samvloeberghs.be',
  };

  res.render('index', config);
};

app.get('*', ngApp);

// Start up the Node server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Node server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
</code></pre>

  <p>
    <strong>Line 54 is where the actual rendering magic happens</strong>. <code>res.render</code> will return a 200
    response automatically, with the static HTML of the server-side rendered page of your Angular application. Later we
    will learn how we can hook into this.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest is all Express framework and Universal configuration. If you want to learn more about the code and
    configuration shown above, please <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=angular+universal" rel="noopener"

  <h2>
    <span>
      Why cache?
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    The content of our example routes or pages is very unlikely to change often, so there is absolutely <em>no need to
    render the Angular application each time</em> the page gets requested. We can simply cache the generated HTML on
    the first time visit, store it in a memory cache and retrieve it when the next visitor hits your website.
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as the content changes, we need to clear the cache and let the cache get regenerated. This can happen the
    first time your updated page gets a visit, but other strategies are possible as well.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
    A simple memory-cache implementation
    </span>
  </h2>

  <img
    src="/posts/creating-a-simple-memory-cache-for-your-angular-universal-website-or-application/universal_basic_render_cache_mechanism.png"
    alt="Angular Universal : Basic rendering diagram / flow extended with caching mechanism"
    class="extraspace"/>

  <p>
    Let's extend our previous diagram for basic rendering with Universal with a simple cache mechanism.
    The diagram above visually shows us what we need to do to, but let's go through it step-by-step:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The browser requests a specific page from your server, for example the dynamic page
      <code><a href="/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation" target="_blank">/posts/scroll-to-top-on-angular-router-navigation</a></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server checks if there is a cached version of the page available.
      The first time we visit the page, there is no cached version.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server receives the request and renders the Angular application, by fetching the content from the JSON
      datasource.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server outputs the static HTML and stores it in the cache.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server returns the same static HTML as the response to the browser.
    </li>
    <li>
      The next visitor visits the exact same page.
    </li>
    <li>
      You could already have seen it coming, the server checks again if there is a cached version available and reads it
      from the caching registry.
    </li>
    <li>
      The server returns the cached static HTML as the response to the browser.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    As you can see, this is no rocket science. It's just a little bit of extra fun work, implementing our simple cache
    and adapting the basic code for server side rendering. In the next sections we will learn that the extra code to
    reach this goal is minimal and easy to set up.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Our simple in-memory caching mechanism</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    First of all, let's see how <em>our cache implementation</em> would look like. We need a simple CRUD interface to be
    able to <em>update, read and delete our cache entries</em>. By using the package
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/memory-cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>memory-cache</code></a>
    we receive the required functionality out of the box! The API is as clear as it can be:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-ts line-numbers">const cache = require('memory-cache');

// set or overwrite a value in the cache
cache.put('foo', 'bar');

// retrieve value from the cache
const cachedValue = cache.get('foo');

// delete key from cache
cache.del('foo');

// clear cache completely
cache.clear();
</code></pre>


  <h3>
    <span>Code for cached rendering</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    As previously mentioned, <code>res.render</code> is where the rendering magic happens. By default
    <code>res.render('index', config)</code> returns the static HTML on the response. <code>res.render</code> also
    accepts an optional callback we can implement with our custom behavior. We can extend the highlighted
    <code>ngApp</code> function from our basic example without caching:
  </p>

  <pre data-line="11-25"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">const ngApp = (req, res) => {
  const config = {
    req,
    res,
    preboot: true,
    baseUrl: '/',
    requestUrl: req.originalUrl,
    originUrl: 'http://localhost:80',
  };

  const allowedPages = ['/', '/about', '/contact'];

  if (allowedPages.includes(req.originalUrl)) {
    const entry = cache.get(req.originalUrl); // check if we have a cache entry
    if (entry) {
      res.send(entry);                        // send the cache entry
    } else {
      res.render('index', config, (err, html) => {
        cache.put(req.originalUrl, html);     // save the HTML in the cache
        res.send(html);
      });
    }
  } else {
    res.render('index', config);              // just render with no cache
  }
};
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Let's go trough the code and explain what is going on:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Line 13 is a first check to see if we should leverage the cache for this specific request by checking if the
      requested URL is allowed for caching.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next we check if there is a cache entry for this request. If so we return the cached HTML.
    </li>
    <li>
      If we don't have a cache entry for this request, we continue with normal Universal SSR and we save the result HTML
      in the cache before we return it as the response.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <span>Cache only the existing pages</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Be careful with what you cache!</strong> You should only cache the pages that actually exist on your
    application or website, or make sense to cache. So <em>avoid the caching of non-existing pages</em>. This could
    potentially lead to a memory-issue on your server..
  </p>
  <p>
    The only thing a malicious visitor has to do is visit an unlimited amount of unexisting variants
    (<code>/about1</code>, <code>/about2</code>, ... ) of an existing page (<code>/about</code>) and your (memory) cache
    will get flooded with 404 not found pages. Consequently your server will become very slow and might eventually even
    crash.
  </p>
  <p>
    A simple way to mitigate this risk is by using (a variant of) your <code>sitemap.xml</code> to whitelist
    the allowed pages. This is implemented on line 11-13 of the code shown above. In this case we are only allowing the
    <code>/</code>, <code>/about</code> and <code>/contact</code> pages to be cached.
  </p>

  <h2><span>Possible extensions and improvements</span></h2>

  <p>
    The concepts explained above only touch the basics of implementing a caching strategy and infrastructure.
    There are several improvements possible that I will explain briefly.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Generate your static versions at build time
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an interface for your cache
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a separate caching layer
    </li>
    <li>
      Server-side render only specific pages
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a file based cache instead of memory cache
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <span>Generate your static versions at build time</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Instead of letting the first visitor of your website be responsible for generating the first cached version
    of specific pages, we can <em>generate the static versions of all the pages of our application at build time</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can do this for example after <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener">generating our sitemap.xml</a>. At that point we know all the
    available urls of our application/website and we can generate the static versions of those pages and put them
    in the cache.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Create an interface for your cache</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Maintaining the cache of a small website like this one is easy. Everytime a new version is availables, I clear the
    cache completely. The first visitor of a specific page is now responsible for creating the cached version.
  </p>

  <p>
    In bigger applications <em>an interface to dynamicaly update and clean the cache</em> is required. For example, when
    using a CMS to add a page or blogpost you can trigger a cache-request right after saving the content. If you delete
    a page, you can whipe out the cache, to make sure your visitors are not seeing a page that is already deleted.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-warning">
    <i class="fa fa-warning"></i>
    Be sure to implement some security on this interface. You don't want somebody malicious messing with your cache.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Use a separate caching layer</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    In this example we have implemented <em>caching at the level of the serving application</em>. This couples our
    server software directly to the caching infrastructure. A more advanced approach would be to install a caching layer
    right before the application server.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can either be a completely different (virtual) machine, or run as an extra service
    on the same machine as the one running our Node.js Express server. This way we can <em>decouple our caching
    infrastructure completely from our serving application</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Server-side render only specific pages</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>In some cases it might not be required to SSR and cache all pages of your application</strong>. You might
    have a public facing part of your application and a private part that requires a login. The content of the private
    part could be very volatile, so caching is perhaps not the best option there.
  </p>

  <pre data-line="2, 25"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">// Our index.html we'll use as our template
const template = readFileSync(join(DIST_FOLDER, 'browser', 'index.html')).toString();

app.engine('html', (_, options, callback) => {
  renderModuleFactory(AppServerModuleNgFactory, {
    document: template,
    // ...
  }).then(html => {
    callback(null, html);
  });
});

const cache = require('memory-cache');

const ngApp = (req, res) => {
  const config = {
    // ...
  };

  const allowedPages = ['/', '/about', '/contact'];

  if (allowedPages.includes(req.originalUrl)) {
    // ...
  } else {
    res.send(template); // just return the templates
  }
};
</code></pre>

  <p>
    We did not change much compared to the caching example. The only thing we now do is return the original template
    directly, imported on line 2, in case of a request that should not be SSRed and cached. This is your original
    <code>index.html</code> file, so returning this as the response to the browser will just make
    the browser bootstrap your Angular application.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Use a file based cache instead of memory cache</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Using a cache that lives in the memory is just one option. If for some reason you don't have much RAM available,
    but you have plenty of disk space, <strong>you could opt for a cache living on the file system. Entries would then
    just be like static HTML files saved on the disk</strong>. The only drawback I see is the <em>potential extra I/O
    overhead</em> reading and writing a file introduces.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
      Conclusion
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Setting up a simple memory cache is no rocket-science and <em>requires minimal changes to our Universal setup</em>.
    The basic idea of using a memory cache is easily extended to for example a file cache. Adapting it to your needs is
    easy because we can hook in to the rendering process.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have to remember this is <em>a very basic setup that requires extension and improvements</em> if we are going to
    use this on bigger applications and projects.
