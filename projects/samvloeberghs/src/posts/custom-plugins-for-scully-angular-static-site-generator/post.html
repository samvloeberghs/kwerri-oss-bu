      (<strong>Work in progress</strong>) Scully or Angular Universal, what is the difference?

  </ol>

  <h2>Target audience</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scully, the Static Site Generator for
      Angular</a>, comes with a plugin system that allows us to control which pages to prerender of our Angular
    application and how to prerender them. In this article we will <em>learn how to setup custom plugins</em> for your
    own specific usecases. If you care about the performance of your Angular application or website, please continue
    reading.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Scully?</h2>

  <p>
    Scully is basically a static site generator, or SSG, for Angular. It takes your full-blown Angular application and
    transforms the stable state of all the publicly available pages into a static HTML snapshot. You can deploy these
    HTML pages to a static webserver, with or without the original Angular application, and your application will load
    instantly. Even without JS enabled, because all the content is available in the original HTML returned from the
    server.
  </p>

  <p>
    This has some important consequences and benefits. The most important one is that <em>the content of your page is
    available instantly</em>. After your HTML page has loaded, the application can still bootstrap as the Angular app, giving you
    the full SPA functionality. But meanwhile the user will not be blocked to read or use the page until the Angular app
    has started up.
  </p>

  <h3>Getting started with Scully</h3>

  <p>
    Getting started with Scully is easy. The
    <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      documentation on the Github project</a> will get you going setting up your first project. At the bottom of the
    article you can find more links and recources about setting up Scully.
  </p>

  <h3>Support for plugins</h3>

  <p>
    Scully is able to generate your pages because of a discovery process that finds the available routes of your
    application by scanning your routing modules. Some routes are easy to discover, like for example the
    <code>/about</code> route. But other routes, for example dynamic routes like <code>/blog/:slug</code>, need to be
    listed based on known data, coming from for example a DB or API interface.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lists of available pages for these dynamic routes are build using plugins. As example, Scully has a built-in
    routerplugin of type <code>json</code> that will load a JSON list and use the items in the list as a source for the available pages.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">scully.config.js</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">const {
  RouteTypes,
} = require('@scullyio/scully');

exports.config = {
  routes: {
    '/user/:userId': {
      type: RouteTypes.json,
      userId: {
        url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users',
        property: 'id',
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    If we consider that our JSON source <code><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                                                    href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users">
    https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users</a></code> has around 10 users, this plugin
    will add 10 routes to prerender using our Angular application and Scully. Scully keeps track of the complete list to
    prerender in the <code>/src/assets/scully-routes.json</code> file.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">/src/assets/scully-routes.json</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-json line-numbers">[
  {"route": "/"}, {"route": "/about"},
  ...
  {"route": "/users/1"},
  {"route": "/users/2"},
  ...
  {"route": "/user/10"}
]</code></pre>

  <p>
    The next step is building our own plugins, but let's first shine some light on the example project we will use to
    explain the details and decide which plugins we need to build.
  </p>

  <h2>Example project</h2>

  <p>
    The example is a simple Angular application with a few static routes, like <code>/about</code> and dynamic routes
    like <code>/news</code> that lists the available newsitems and <code>/news/:id/:slug</code> that shows the detail
    of a newsitem. The list of newsitems is retrieved from a static resource <code>/assets/news.json</code> and the
    newsdetail is available at <code>/assets/news/{id}.json</code>.
  </p>

       src="/posts/angular-v9-universal-ssr-and-prerendering-out-of-the-box/example_app.gif"
       alt=""/>

  <p>
    Based on the data of <code>/assets/news.json</code> the list of all routes for our example application looks like
    this:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">/src/assets/scully-routes.json</h4>
  <pre><code class="language-json line-numbers">[
  {"route":"/"},
  {"route":"/about"},
  {"route":"/news"},
  {"route":"/news/archive"},
  {"route":"/news/1/newsitem-1"},
  {"route":"/news/2/newsitem-2"},
  {"route":"/news/5/newsitem-5"},
  {"route":"/news/99/newsitem-99"}
]</code></pre>
