    <span>
     Better detection for first install with service worker
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    In my <a href="/posts/lessons-learned-on-offline-capabilities-with-service-workers-using-workbox">previous post
    about service workers and Workbox</a> I used a somewhat shady technique with a refresh to activate the service
    worker functionality on the first load of the application. <em>This is completely unnecessary</em>
    and the outcome can be achieved using other techniques.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we consider the code to register the service worker from the previous post, the only thing we have to change is
    send an event to the service worker, to claim the clients instead of reloading the page. This is demonstrated on
    line 18 and 23 in the following code. The logic to detect a first service worker remained unchanged.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker-registration.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="18,23"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">// Check that service workers are available
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Use the window load event to keep the page load performant
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js').then(registration => {
      if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {
        // let the application know our service worker is ready
        window['serviceWorkerReady'] = true;
        window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('service-worker-ready'));
      }

      // A wild service worker has appeared in reg.installing and maybe in waiting!
      const newWorker = registration.installing;
      const waitingWoker = registration.waiting;

      if (newWorker) {
        if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
          newWorker.postMessage({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
        }
        newWorker.addEventListener('statechange', () => {
          // newWorker.state has changed
          if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
            newWorker.postMessage({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
          }
        });
      }
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log('service worker could not be registered', err);
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    For this to work we need to make our service worker react to messages and claim the clients for this installation
    of the service worker. We do this by registering an event listener on the <code>message</code> event:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker.js</h4>
  <pre data-line="5,15"><code class="language-js line-numbers">// ... sw functionality

self.addEventListener('message', event => {
  if (event.data && event.data.type === 'CLIENTS_CLAIM') {
    self.clients.claim();
  }
});
</code></pre>

  <p>
    If a service worker is installed, but not controlling the page yet, an event that matches the type
    <code>CLIENTS_CLAIM</code> will claim the clients and activate the service worker for those clients.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Using Workbox Window to solve the same problem</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    With Workbox Window we can listen for the <code>activated</code> event on the service worker registration.
    This events holds a property <code>isUpdate</code> that indicates if a previous version was controlling the page.
    If not, we can assume this is a first time install.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker-registration-workbox-window.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="8,15"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';

const wb = new Workbox('/service-worker.js', {});

wb.addEventListener('activated', async event => {
  // `event.isUpdate` will be true if another version of the service
  // worker was controlling the page when this version was registered.
  if (!event.isUpdate) {
    // If your service worker is configured to precache assets, those
    // assets should all be available now.

    // Send a message telling the service worker to claim the clients
    // This is the first install, so the functionality of the app
    // should meet the functionality of the service worker!
    wb.messageSW({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
  }
});

wb.register();
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Similar to our previous example, without Workbox Window, our service worker needs to be listening to messages and
    act accordingly on the message of type <code>CLIENTS_CLAIM</code>. <code>wb.messageSW</code> is a wrapper function
    that provides a message and reply mechanism using a <code>MessageChannel</code> but also just send a message to the
    service worker using <code>postMessage</code>.
