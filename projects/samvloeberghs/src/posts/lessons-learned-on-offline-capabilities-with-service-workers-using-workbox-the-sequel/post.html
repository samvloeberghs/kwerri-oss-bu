  <h2>
    <span>
     Better detection for a first-time install of a service worker
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    In my <a href="/posts/lessons-learned-on-offline-capabilities-with-service-workers-using-workbox">previous post
    about service workers and Workbox</a> I used a somewhat shady technique with a refresh to activate the service
    worker functionality on the first load of the application. <em>This is completely unnecessary</em>
    and the same outcome can be achieved using other techniques.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we consider the code to register the service worker from the previous post, the only thing we have to change is
    <em>send an event to the service worker to claim the clients</em>, instead of reloading the page. This is
    demonstrated on line 19 and 25 in the following code. The logic to detect a first service worker remained unchanged.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker-registration.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="19,25"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">// Check that service workers are available
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Use the window load event to keep the page load performant
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js').then(registration => {
      if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {
        // let the application know our service worker is ready
        window['serviceWorkerReady'] = true;
        window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('service-worker-ready'));
      }

      // A wild service worker has appeared in reg.installing and maybe in waiting!
      const newWorker = registration.installing;
      const waitingWoker = registration.waiting;

      if (newWorker) {
        if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
          // - no more window.location.reload();
          newWorker.postMessage({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
        }
        newWorker.addEventListener('statechange', () => {
          // newWorker.state has changed
          if (newWorker.state === 'activated' && !waitingWoker) {
            // - no more window.location.reload();
            newWorker.postMessage({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
          }
        });
      }
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log('service worker could not be registered', err);
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    For this to work we need to make our service worker react to messages and claim the clients for this installation
    of the service worker. We do this by registering an event listener on the <code>message</code> event:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker.js</h4>
  <pre data-line="5"><code class="language-js line-numbers">// ... other sw functionality

self.addEventListener('message', event => {
    if (event.data && event.data.type === 'CLIENTS_CLAIM') {
    self.clients.claim();
  }
});
</code></pre>

  <p>
    If a service worker is installed, but not controlling the page yet, an event that matches the type
    <code>CLIENTS_CLAIM</code> will claim the clients and activate the service worker for those clients.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Using Workbox Window to solve the same problem</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    With Workbox Window we can listen for the <code>activated</code> event on the service worker registration.
    This events holds a property <code>isUpdate</code> that indicates if a previous version was controlling the page.
    If not, we can safely assume this is a first time install.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">service-worker-registration-workbox-window.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="8,14"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';

const wb = new Workbox('/service-worker.js', {});

wb.addEventListener('activated', async event => {
  // `event.isUpdate` will be true if another version of the service
  // worker was controlling the page when this version was registered.
  if (!event.isUpdate) {
    // If your service worker is configured to precache assets, those
    // assets should all be available now.
    // So send a message telling the service worker to claim the clients
    // This is the first install, so the functionality of the app
    // should meet the functionality of the service worker!
    wb.messageSW({ type: 'CLIENTS_CLAIM' });
  }
});

wb.register();
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Similar to our previous example, without Workbox Window, our service worker needs to be listening to messages and
    act accordingly on the message of type <code>CLIENTS_CLAIM</code>. <code>wb.messageSW</code> is a Workbox wrapper
    function that provides a message and reply mechanism using a <code>MessageChannel</code> but basically just sends a
    message to the service worker using <code>postMessage</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>
     Updating the application while it's in use
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    With PWA's installed on the homescreeen and opened as native-like applications it's possible that those
    <em>applications are opened for a long time</em>. Updating a new version of the application and installing a new
    service worker could potentially by extended or postponed for a long time, until the user closes and reopens the
    application, or refreshes the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's even <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/overscroll-behavior" rel="noopener"
                            target="_blank">possible to disable the refresh by pulling down the application
    completely</a>. This could be done if the functionality requires it. In case of for example a full screen map,
    pinching, zooming and other gestures could lead to an unexpected refresh.
  </p>
  <p>
    In those cases the only way of updating seems to be closing and reopening the application. <strong>Fortunately it's
    not</strong>. There are several ways of doing an update in-application. By means of <em>user-intent</em>, when the
    <em>application becomes visible</em> again or by <em>setting up an interval</em>. Let's explore these 3 options.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Update application by user-intent</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    The simplest way of asking for an update to the application is by <em>letting the user click a button</em>. So we are gonna
    take this example to show how to update the application while running it. The other options and examples are just
    defining a different approach or intent to update.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be able to update our application while running it we need to make sure that we <em>keep track of the original
    service worker registration</em>. Checking for a new version and performing an update is then as simple as just
    calling <code>swRegistration.update()</code>. Please consider the following <code>ServiceWorkerService</code>:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">app-update-user-intent.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="9,18,28"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class ServiceWorkerService {

  private swRegistration: ServiceWorkerRegistration;

  constructor() {
    this.registerServiceWorker();
  }

  public async checkForUpdate() {
    try {
      console.log('updating sw');
      return await this.swRegistration.update();
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('sw.js could not be updated', err);
    }
  }

  private async registerServiceWorker() {
    const wb = new Workbox('/sw.js', {});

    try {
      this.swRegistration = await wb.register();
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('error registering service worker', e);
    }
  }

}</code></pre>

  <p>
    This Angular example service, <em>which can BTW be easily ported to any framework</em>, registers the service worker as soon
    as the service gets instantiated. The <code>register</code> method call on the Workbox instance gives us a native
    <code>ServiceWorkerRegistration</code> that we save in the <code>serviceWorkerRegistration</code> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now any button in the application can be coupled to check for an update of the application by calling the
    <code>checkForUpdate</code> method. This method uses the previously saved <code>swRegistration</code> and calls
    <code>update</code> on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>update</code> method tries to update the service worker by fetching the registration's URL. In case there
    is a <em>byte-by-byte difference</em> to the current service worker, the new service worker will ge installed. After
    its potential new resources have been cached and the logic has been loaded it will eventually go in a waiting state.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Handling the new but waiting service worker</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Whenever our application gets a hold of a new but waiting service worker, we can safely assume that our application
    can be updated. So we show a message to the user that an action, like refreshing the page, can be invoked to load
    the new functionality. By using this approach we <em>keep the responsibility with the user</em> to load the new version.
  </p>

  <p class="alert alert-warning">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
    Immediately activating the new service worker, by using <code>skipWaiting()</code> and/or <code>clients.claim()</code>
    for all the clients when it becomes waiting can potentially break your application. The functionality from the new
    service worker could not be compatible with the currently loaded old version of your application.
    <a href="/posts/lessons-learned-on-offline-capabilities-with-service-workers-using-workbox">Read more about this consideration in my previous blogpost</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we dive further into the code and details for this example, <em>we will go trough the most simple use-case
    that describes the desired functionality</em>:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The user already visited our application before, so there is an active service worker for our application in
      the browser.
    </li>
    <li>
      During usage of the application, we deploy a new version. The user clicks a button to check and finds
      the new version of our application. The new service worker installs and goes into waiting state.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our application is notified of this new version and shows the user an update button to express his further intent.
      Meanwhile the new service worker stays in waiting state.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the user clicks the update button, our new service worker is informed and skips the waiting phase.
      As soon as the new service worker finishes his caching work and install process it becomes activated.
    </li>
    <li>
      The application gets notified and refreshes to load the complete new version of the application. If we wouldn't
      reload we might have the situation that the functionality of our new service worker is not compatible with
      our currently loaded application.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <span>Listening for a new service worker</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Listening for a new waiting service worker using Workbox when we try an update from within the application is a
    little bit unexpected and different from handling a new waiting service worker after a refresh. For these situations
    Workbox dispatches lifecycle events like <code>externalinstalling</code> when updates are arriving from "external"
    service workers. Any version which is not the current Workbox instance or service worker registration can be
    considered as external.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">app-update-external.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="43, 48-50, 53, 67-69, 58, 62"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { BehaviorSubject, Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { filter, first } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';

declare const window: any;

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class EnvironmentService {

  public newVersionAvailable$: Observable<boolean>;

  private readonly newVersionAvailable = new BehaviorSubject(false);
  private readonly applicationUpdateRequested = new BehaviorSubject(false);
  // check every 4h if a new version is available
  private readonly swUpdateInterval = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

  private swRegistration: ServiceWorkerRegistration;

  constructor() {
    this.newVersionAvailable$ = this.newVersionAvailable.asObservable();
    this.registerServiceWorker();
  }

  public update() {
    this.applicationUpdateRequested.next(true);
  }

  public async checkForUpdate() {
    // ...
  }

  private async registerServiceWorker() {
    const wb = new Workbox('/sw.js', {});

    // ...

    // we use this waiting listener to handle the update we do
    // based on an interval, user intent or visibility change
    // in this case another service worker became waiting
    wb.addEventListener('externalwaiting', event => {
      // inform any functionality that is interested in this update
      this.newVersionAvailable.next(true);

      // listen to application update requests
      this.applicationUpdateRequested.pipe(
        filter((applicationUpdateRequested) => applicationUpdateRequested),
        first(),
      ).subscribe(_ => {
        // Send a message telling the service worker to skip waiting and become active.
        event.sw.postMessage({ type: 'SKIP_WAITING' });
      });
    });

    // the other service worker became actived!
    wb.addEventListener('externalactivated', () => {
      // If your service worker is configured to precache assets, those
      // assets should all be available now.
      // This activation was on request of the user, so let's finally reload the page
      window.location.reload();
    });

    try {
      this.swRegistration = await wb.register();
      setInterval(async () => {
        this.checkForUpdate();
      }, this.swUpdateInterval);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('error registering service worker', e);
    }
  }

}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Let's map our usecase written out above onto the code:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      We assume an active service worker is available while running a <code>checkForUpdate</code>(line 68) and a new
      version of the application is found and installing
    </li>
    <li>
      Our event listener for <code>externalwaiting</code>(line 43) receives a new event and updates the application that
      a new version is available. This value is exposed as an Observable in the application, so we can show a
      notification.
    </li>
    <li>
      The event listener subscribes and starts listening to the user intent to update the application to the new
      version (line 48-50). When the user gives his go, an event <code>SKIP_WAITING</code> is sent to the service
      worker, instructing it to become activated (line 53).
    </li>
    <li>
        The event listener <code>externalactivated</code> receives a new event, indicating that the new service worker
        became activated (line 58). Now we can reload to activate the complete new application (line 62)!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
    The full code for handling all these usecases combined, including the following strategies, is <a href="https://github.com/samvloeberghs/kwerri-oss/blob/master/projects/sw-lessons/src/app/environment.service.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big pile of code which you can find here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Update application when it becomes visible again</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Another strategy to try and update your application can be <em>based on the visibility of your application</em>. As
    soon as your functionality is loaded, we can start listening to the <code>visibilitychange</code> event on the
    <code>document</code> as shown in the highlighted code below.
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">app-update-visible.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="14,19-23"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class ServiceWorkerService {

  // ...

  constructor() {
    this.registerServiceWorker();
    this.registerVisibileChangeListener();
  }

  // ...

  private registerVisibileChangeListener() {
    fromEvent(document, 'visibilitychange').subscribe(() => {
      this.checkForUpdate();
    });
  }

}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Now every time your application gets hidden, for example when opening a new tab in your browser or opening a new
    application on your smartphone, and you choose to make the tab visible again, or you reopen the application, the
    app will try to update the service worker.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <span>Update application by setting up an interval</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    One more other strategy is <em>requesting an update on an interval</em>, for example every 4 hours. This way the
    user will be presented with the update possibility automatically if a new version has been deployed recently.
    The extra logic / code for this is a simple 3-liner as highlighted below:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">app-update-interval.ts</h4>
  <pre data-line="10, 20-22"><code class="language-ts line-numbers">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Workbox } from 'workbox-window';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class ServiceWorkerService {

  // check every 4h if a new version is available
  private readonly swUpdateInterval = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000

  // ...

  private async registerServiceWorker() {
    const wb = new Workbox('/sw.js', {});

    try {
      this.swRegistration = await wb.register();

      setInterval(async () => {
        this.checkForUpdate();
      }, this.swUpdateInterval);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('error registering service worker', e);
    }
  }

}
</code></pre>

  <h2>
    <span>
    Conclusion
    </span>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Today we learned a better way of controlling the application with our service worker on the very first load. Instead
    of refreshing we use the <code>clients.claim()</code> method, but in a way that we won't potentially break our
    application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, we have explored a few ideas on how to update our application from within the application. This is
    particularly useful if our applications are long-living and we want to make sure our users get the latest
    functionalities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Workbox and service workers in general still have many unknown capabilities that I'm learning about. But while we
    keep developing we explore new ideas and ways of optimizing our code. I think I will be writing more about service
    workers in the future :)
