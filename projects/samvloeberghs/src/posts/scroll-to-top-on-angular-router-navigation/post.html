    When I was creating this blog and optimising it for mobile I experienced some default but not so user-friendly
    behaviour when navigating from one route to the other with Angular.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is that content on mobile can go very deep below the initial viewport height. So when you're
    scrolling down and you press an internal link to another page, you'll be stuck at that height.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is somewhat different from standard navigation between pages in a normal webapplication, where the page
    reloads and you start from the top by default. In a S.P.A. this can easily be solved by scrolling to the top on
    navigation by using the native <code>window.scroll</code> function:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">window.scroll(0,0)</code></pre>

  <p>
    A navigation in routing in Angular 1 and ngRoute or even the ui-router can easily be dectected by listening to
    the event
    <code>$routeChangeSuccess</code> or <code>$stateChangeSuccess</code>. So combining these 2 <esx></esx>sentials gives us:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">angular-js-route-state-change.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">// ngRoute:
$rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', () => {
    $window.scroll(0,0);
});

// ui-router:
$rootScope.$on('$stateChangeSuccess', () => {
    $window.scroll(0,0);
});</code></pre>

  <p>
    I did not find anything similar in the documentation of the router of Angular so I went digging. The fact is
    that I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2" target="_blank">Angulartics2 plugin</a>
    by <a href="https://twitter.com/luisfarzati" target="_blank">@luisfarzati</a> to track you guys' behavior :).
    This is also done on navigation so there must be something similar going on at that plugin. The plugin BTW works
    great!
  </p>

  <h2><span>Listening to navigation events in Angular</span></h2>

  <p>
    It seems that the Angular v2+ router has an <code>events</code> Observable property which you can subscribe on.
    Yes, it is as simple as that. Those events can be of any predefined type <code>NavigationStart</code>,
    <code>NavigationCancel</code>, <code>NavigationEnd</code> or <code>NavigationError</code>. In my case I only
    needed the <code>NavigationEnd</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the component that holds your navigation <code>router-outlet</code> you just need to setup the listener,
    something like this:
  </p>

  <h4 class="codetitle">app.component.ts</h4>
  <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';
import { ViewportScroller } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'sv-app',
  template: '&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;'
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(
    readonly router: Router,
    readonly viewportScroller: ViewportScroller
  ) {

    router.events
      .filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd)
      .subscribe((event: NavigationEnd) => {
        // Angular v2-v6
        window.scroll(0, 0);
        // Angular v7+
        this.viewportScroller.scrollToPosition([0, 0]);
      });

  }
}
</code></pre>

  <p>
    And that was it! Be aware that the <code>window</code> object might not be available in every context, except
    the browser.

    you might want to wrap your <code>window</code> object reference!
  </p>
  <p>
    Please also be careful not to use these events to do business logic, like for example checking if
    you can navigate to a specific route based on some authentication rules. For those cases you may want to
    implement guards! More information about guards can be found in
