  <p>
    In order to reach the desired <strong>performance and capabilities like proper SEO and social network shareable
    Angular routes</strong> you will most probably already figured out that you need the full HTML of your Angular pages
    <strong>delivered to the client by the server</strong>, and not just the static assets that bootstrap your Angular
    application in the browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    To achieve this we currently have two notable options. Implementing
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/universal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Universal</a> techniques into our
    Angular application, or using <a href="https://scully.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scully, the static site
    generator for Angular</a>. Both will give us the same result; an even more performant Angular application.
    <strong>But what is the difference? When to use Universal, or when to use Scully? Let's try to find out!</strong>
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-does-angular-universal-work">How does Angular Universal work?</h2>

  <h3 id="universal-the-full-textual-version">The full textual version</h3>

  <p>
    In the most typical situation, Angular gets bootstrapped in the browser. Universal provides developers an alternative
    to bootstrap Angular in a Node.js runtime, server-side render the given Angular route and return the full HTML to the
    browser. We have two options. In this first case, Angular Universal is <strong>used at run-time</strong>. When using
    an npm script that calls a node script, we can prerender our pages with Universal <strong>at build-time</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this to work, Node.js needs to know when the Angular application is stable. Angular is capable of knowing
    this by the implementation of the <code>isStable</code> observable on the
    <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/core/ApplicationRef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ApplicationRef</a></code>
    service. The <code>isStable</code> observable is based on the <code>onStable</code> observable of zone.js. Zone.js
    basically hooks in on the event loop and keeps track of all the micro / macro tasks that are pending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical examples of these pending tasks are HTTP calls, like the fetch promise, for showing dynamic data on a page.
    Another example is the <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> function. As soon as there are no more
    of those tasks pending, the <code>onStable</code> observable of zone.js informs the observer of the <code>isStable</code>
    observable in Angular to emit a <code>true</code> value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>@angular/platform-server</code> module exports <a
    href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-server/src/utils.ts"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">several functions to bootstrap the Angular application at a
    specific route</a> in the Node.js process. After bootstrapping the Angular application, the function starts
    listening on the <code>isStable</code> observable. When this emits a true value, the script knows that the page is
    rendered, and can be serialized to static HTML.
  </p>

       alt="Universal step by step"/>

  <p>
    The animated image shown above is a <strong>simplified visualisation of the process of server-side generating pages
    at run-time with Universal</strong>. Let's break down the different steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The browser makes a request to the server for page <code>/news/1/slug</code>.</li>
    <li>Our Node.js server identifies these requests as a navigation request and passes the request to the Angular
      Universal application.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Angular app builds up the components and pages like it would normally do in the browser. Meanwhile zone.js and
      Angular keep track of the stability of the application.
    </li>
    <li>
      Async operations, like HTTP calls and timeouts are what make the application unstable.
    </li>
    <li>
      As soon as all operations are done and the zone becomes stable our Angular app is informed and becomes stable.
    </li>
    <li>We can now generate, or serialize, the HTML</li>
    <li>
      Our Angular Universal setup returns the full HTML to the Node.js server which returns it to the client.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="universal-key-points-of-consideration">Key points of consideration for Universal</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Universal requires strict discipline in coding. You can't access the <code>document</code>,
      <code>window</code>, and <code>navigator</code> objects for example, as they do not exist on the server.
      This means you will have to code for the platform the code will be potentially running on. For example, accessing
      cookies in the browser can be done via the
      <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie"
               rel="noopener" target="_blank">document</a></code> object but on the server we need to read out the
      same cookies from the Node.js <code><a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_request_getheader_name"
                                            rel="noopener" target="_blank">request</a></code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Many 3rd party libraries access the DOM, or any of the other objects mentioned before. Some of them include
      intervals or timeouts that are not easy to discover. So when using them with a Universal setup, you can expect to
      be coding around them. To do this, you can make use of the
      <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/common/isPlatformServer"
               rel="noopener" target="_blank">isPlatformServer(platformId: Object)</a></code> or
      <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/common/isPlatformBrowser"
               rel="noopener" target="_blank">isPlatformBrowser(platformId: Object)</a></code>
      functions. If you don't know what you are doing, this process might be very frustrating and difficult to debug. So
      proceed with caution and get informed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using <code>isPlatformBrowser</code> or <code>isPlatformServer</code> is one way of solving the issue.
      Another approach is by using dependency injection. As you most probably will have a <code>AppModule</code> for
      the browser and a <code>AppServerModule</code> for the server, you can use one service that defines the interface
      for reading out cookies, with a class that reads out the cookies from the Node.js <code>request</code> on the
      server and
      another class that reads out the cookies from the <code>document</code> object. By providing them with
      <code><a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-providers" rel="noopener"
               target="_blank">useClass</a></code>, you switch one out for the other, depending on the platform
      (Node.js or browser context).
    </li>
    <li>
      Because of the Node.js server we can set up more advanced infrastructures, like adding caching layers and updating
      our cached pages on the fly at run-time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Universal runs in a Node.js context, meaning you can also use Universal to prerender your pages to static HTML as
      a build-step. In this case, you don't need Node.js as a server, but only as a build tool. Your build tool will have
      to be clever enough to render all the required pages. In this case, Angular Universal is <strong>used at
      build time</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use Universal at build time, prerendering pages will take much less time than prerendering them with Scully.
      The cost of implementing Scully might be significantly lower though.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="alert alert--warning">
    <em>Important</em>: You need to <strong>be careful with long-running tasks</strong> like <code>setTimeout</code>,
    intervals and observables that never complete. This will prevent the application from evolving to a stable state in
    an acceptable amount of time and potentially never become stable. If you do need for example an interval, use one of the
    described techniques (dependency injection or the <code>isPlatformBrowser</code> function) to only run those in the
    browser context.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-does-scully-work">How does Scully work</h2>

  <h3 id="scully-the-full-textual-version">The full textual version</h3>

  <p>
    Scully is almost completely separated from your Angular application and can be configured via an external JavaScript
    config file. This config file, named <code>scully.your-project-name.config.js</code> and located at the root of
    your project, allows us to provide options and extra's like <strong>configuring plugins and specific ways of
    handling different routes</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only direct coupling to the Angular app is the injection of the <code>ScullyLibModule</code> module.
    This module is automatically injected in the app's root module when you run the schematic
    <code>ng add @scullyio/init</code>. The module provides one important service, the <code>IdleMonitorService</code>,
    which handles the logic to inform the Scully process about the stability of the application. This concept is no
    different from the stability concept used at Angular Universal applications, it's just implemented slightly different.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>IdleMonitorService</code> provides multiple ways of monitoring the state of the application. This means
    the service knows when the application is stable, or in this case <strong>idle</strong>. For this, the service is
    hooking into the routing events. When the router sends the event <code>NavigationEnd</code> the service checks for
    any pending macrotask in the zone, like for example ongoing http calls. As soon as the service believes the app is
    stable, the <code>AngularReady</code> event is triggered on the <code>window</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When running Scully the generator first collects all the routes that need to be prerendered. This is done by a
    combination of <a href="https://github.com/guess-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart analysis of the code</a>,
    configuration, and use of plugins that use data to build a potentially very large list of dynamic routes. All those
    routes are loaded in parallel via a pool of instances of
    <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromium/Puppeteer</a>, which is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser" target="_blank">headless browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each route, the process listens to the <code>AngularReady</code> event. As soon as it is received, the process
    knows the page is stable and can be serialized to a static HTML version. Whenever there is something wrong, the
    process tries to generate the page again one more time before failing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scully also allows some configuration to manually handle the <code>AngularReady</code> events to gain more control
    over the stability or idle process. It is also possible to use configurations without zone.js, but that also
    implies that we have less control over the concept of stability. We have to use timeouts and waits or hook into
    the request mechanism of the headless browser, in this case, Puppeteer, to be sure that the page evolved into a
    stable state.
  </p>

  <p>
    The animated image shown above is a <strong>simplified visualisation of the process of prerendering pages at
    build time with Scully</strong>. Let's break down the different steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Before running Scully you need a production build of your application. In the most typical case, this is done
      using the <code>--prod</code> flag.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, we can start up Scully by running <code>npm run scully</code>. This <code>package.json</code> script is
      automatically injected with the <code>ng add @scullyio/init</code> schematic.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Scully process first generates the list of routes. This list can be based on dynamic data depending on the
      configured routes, meaning that the required data needs to be available while generating the routes. This
      data is most probably the same data used for generating the content on those routes. So the application or server
      that provides this data also needs to be running and accessible by the process.
    </li>
    <li>
      The application needs to be running to be able to prerender it. Scully starts a static webserver for your
      production build.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scully starts a pool of instances of Puppeteer. These shared instances of the (headless) browser will be used to
      generate all the pages in parallel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next Scully starts visiting all the routes that it discovered and saved in the list of routes. <strong>The next
      steps are executed for all those routes</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scully instructs Puppeteer to load a specific page.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Angular app bootstraps in the (headless) browser and the navigation to the specific route is executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the first navigation, by checking the router events, Scully monitors the stability of the application and
      sends the <code>AngularReady</code> event.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scully now knows that it can safely instruct Puppeteer to serialize and save the full HTML of the page to the
      filesystem. After processing all the pages, the script is done.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="scully-key-points-of-consideration">Key points of consideration for Scully</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Static pages are generated using a <em>real browser</em>
      (<a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromium/Puppeteer</a>). This
      means we have more support for 3rd party libraries, out of the Angular ecosystem. Those libraries can make use of
      the <code>document</code>, <code>window</code>, and <code>navigator</code> objects and there is no need to code
      around them like we have to do when using Angular Universal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Page generation happens at build time, as compared to Angular Universal, and there is no dynamic webserver
      required. A static webserver is sufficient for serving all the pages and static assets. Having the pages generated
      at build time will <strong>dramatically increase your build time but extremely optimize your runtime</strong>. You
      can't use Scully in a performant way at run-time, for example server-side rendering; the pages would take
      too long to render and load on the server.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you need server-side-rendering for applications that have highly volatile content, you should not consider
      Scully at this point in time. As mentioned before, regenerating those pages at run-time will just take too long.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scully requires an extra build step and setup in the CI/CD process. After each page or data update the pages
      need to be regenerated. For a limited amount of pages, this might be ok, but we need more efficient algorithms to
      take care of regenerating (tens of) thousands of pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The plugin system allows you to hook into the routing and rendering process. This way we can write our own plugins
      for route discovery and manipulation of the rendered code. An example is to <a
      href="/posts/custom-plugins-for-scully-angular-static-site-generator">minify the generated HTML</a> or even
      <a href="/posts/disabling-angular-when-statically-generating-with-scully">disable Angular on the browser
        completely</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prerendering pages with Scully will take more time than prerendering them with Angular Universal. The cost of
      implementing Universal might be significantly higher though.
    </li>
    <li>
      The creators behind Scully have the intention and planned features to have it work with other frameworks,
      like React, Vue, AngularJS, ..
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Both Scully and Universal have their own use cases, and they tackle related problems differently. So the logical
    choice to make totally depends on your project, the size of it, its dependencies, and how strict you want to write
    Angular code and use 3rd party libraries that you can't always control.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>My personal advice:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you have an existing project with a relatively big codebase, perhaps using several 3rd party dependencies, and
      you feel that adding Universal might be a lot of work, take a few hours/days to implement Scully. You might already
      receive the value you need!
    </li>
    <li>
      If you start from scratch, and you don't expect to rely heavily on 3rd party libraries out of the Angular ecosystem
      think about starting with Angular Universal. Your code will be more strict from the start and will
      retain higher quality while you progress in development.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another important point is the number of pages. Regenerating (tens of) thousands of pages on each build/deploy
      might be overkill and take a long time. In this case you can consider Universal with a potential strategy to let
      the first request cache the static version of your page for subsequent loads. There are different strategies for
      <strong><a href="https://www.section.io/blog/what-is-cache-warming/" target="_blank">warming up the cache</a></strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As a good software architect / engineer / developer you need to check your own use case and project-specific needs.
    I hope you can use my observations and lessons learned to come to your own conclusion about what you need! :)
