    <p>
        When I was creating this blog and optimising it for mobile I experienced some default but not so user-friendly
        behaviour when navigating from one route to the other with Angular2.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is that content on mobile can go very deep below the initial viewport height. So when you're
        scrolling down and you press an internal link to another page, you'll be stuck at that height.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is somewhat different from standard navigating between pages in a normal webapplication, where the page
        reloads and you start from the top by default. In a S.P.A. that can easily be solved by scrolling to the top on
        navigation:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">window.scroll(0,0)</code></pre>

    <p>
        In Angular 1 and ngRoute or even the ui-router this could easily be solved by listening to the event
        <code>$routeChangeSuccess</code> or <code>$stateChangeSuccess</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">// ngRoute:
$rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', () => {
    $window.scroll(0,0);
});

// ui-router:
$rootScope.$on('$stateChangeSuccess', () => {
    $window.scroll(0,0);
});</code></pre>

    <p>
        I did not find anything similar in the documentation of the router of Angular2 so I went digging. The fact is
        that I'm using the Angulartics2 plugin by <a href="https://twitter.com/luisfarzati"
                                                     target="_blank">@luisfarzati</a> to track you guys' behavior :)
        This is also done on navigation so there must be something similar going on at that plugin. The plugin BTW works
        great!
    </p>

    <h2><span>Listening to navigation events in Angular2</span></h2>

    <p>
        It seems that the Angular 2 router has an <code>events</code> Observable property which you can subscribe on.
        Yes, it is as simple as that. Those events can be of any predefined type <code>NavigationStart</code>,
        <code>NavigationCancel</code>, <code>NavigationEnd</code> or <code>NavigationError</code>. In my case I only
        needed the <code>NavigationEnd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the component that holds the your navigation <code>router-outlet</code> you just need to setup the listener,
        something like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="typescript highlighted">import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'sv-app',
  template: '&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;'
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(private router: Router) {

    router.events
      .filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd)
      .subscribe((event: NavigationEnd) => {
        scroll(0, 0);
      });

  }
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        And that was it! Please be careful not to use these events to do business logic, like for example checking if
        you can navigate to a specific route based on some authentication rules. For those cases you may want to
        implement guards! More information about guards can be found in
